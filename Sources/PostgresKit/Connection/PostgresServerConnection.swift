/// A server-level connection that manages per-database clients.
///
/// PostgreSQL binds each connection to a single database — there is no `USE database`
/// command. `PostgresServerConnection` solves this by wrapping multiple
/// ``PostgresClient`` instances (one per database) behind a single API.
/// It reuses the original connection's host, port, TLS, and auth settings to create
/// new database-specific clients on demand, caching them for reuse.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// Connect to a server, then request clients for any database:
///
/// ```swift
/// let server = try await PostgresServerConnection.connect(
///     configuration: config,
///     logger: logger
/// )
///
/// // The primary client is always available for server-wide operations.
/// let databases = try await server.primaryClient.listDatabases()
///
/// // Access a specific database — creates a new connection on first call,
/// // returns the cached client on subsequent calls.
/// let analyticsClient = try await server.client(for: "analytics")
/// let rows = try await analyticsClient.simpleQuery("SELECT count(*) FROM events")
///
/// // Requesting the primary database by name returns the same primaryClient.
/// let sameClient = try await server.client(for: server.connectedDatabase)
/// assert(sameClient === server.primaryClient)
///
/// // Clean up all connections when done.
/// await server.closeAll()
/// ```
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// `PostgresServerConnection` is `Sendable`. The internal client cache is protected
/// by an actor, so ``client(for:)`` can be called safely from any task or actor context.
///
/// ## When to Use
///
/// Use `PostgresServerConnection` when your application needs to query across multiple
/// databases on the same server (e.g., a database browser, a multi-tenant system with
/// per-tenant databases, or a migration tool). If you only ever connect to a single
/// database, use ``PostgresClient`` directly.

    /// where ``PostgresConfiguration/database`` is empty and PostgreSQL defaults to the
    /// login username.
